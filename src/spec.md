# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh Zaika Kitchen’s UI with a cohesive, modern “warm culinary” visual theme (colors, typography, spacing) across the app, improving overall polish without changing functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Define and apply a consistent warm, food-inspired design system (palette, typography scale, spacing, radii, shadows) across all pages and shared components.
- Update global Tailwind/Shadcn theme tokens (CSS variables-based approach) for both light and dark modes to ensure premium, consistent backgrounds, borders, and readable contrast.
- Improve typographic hierarchy and consistency (headings/body/captions) across key pages (Home, Menu, Checkout, Contact, Orders/Notifications) without text changes.
- Refine visual layout and styling of Header, Footer, and key page sections (Home hero/sections, Menu tabs/cards, Checkout cart/summary, Contact cards) while preserving existing behaviors and flows.

**User-visible outcome:** The site looks more modern and eye-pleasing with consistent warm colors, improved typography, and refined spacing/elevation across pages in both light and dark mode, while all existing features continue to work the same.
