  "summary": "Diff largely focuses on visual/UX polish (warm theme tokens in index.css, typography hierarchy, updated Tailwind fonts, and redesigned Header/Footer and several pages). However, there are signs of functionality/feature changes (Admin \"Update Starters\" + new mutation) and some pages still hardcode non-warm (blue/purple) status/notification colors, which undermines the cohesive warm culinary theme requirement.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Apply a cohesive, modern “warm culinary” visual theme consistently across all pages.",
      "reason": "Some pages still use explicit blue/purple/green status color classes that may conflict with a cohesive warm, food-inspired palette across the site.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx (notificationColors includes blue/green/purple classes)",
