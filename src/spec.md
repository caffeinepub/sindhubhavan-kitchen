# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Contact page embedded Google Map to pinpoint the restaurant’s correct coordinates.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the app’s configured Google Maps embed URL so the Contact page map centers/pins to latitude 17.689073236620935 and longitude 83.23327778764002.
- Ensure the existing map iframe styling/layout remains unchanged and the “Map location is not configured yet” alert no longer appears when the configured URL is present.

**User-visible outcome:** Opening the Contact page shows the embedded Google Map correctly centered/pinned to the restaurant’s location, with the same map size and container styling as before.
